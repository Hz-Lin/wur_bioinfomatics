    "There is no doubt that the coolest creatures ever to roam the earth were the\n",
    "Dinosaurs. Period. End of discussion. Right?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from [PaleoDB](https://paleobiodb.org) was chosen for two reasons in this course. First, it is a nice\n",
    "example of biological data outside of the normal scope of ‘bioinformatics’. That\n",
    "might sound surprising – aren’t we trying to convert you all to bioinformaticians?\n",
    "Not quite. As we’ve mentioned before, biological sciences in general are becoming\n",
    "ever more data rich, which offers new analytical strategies that may be important\n",
    "for life scientist to master. We hope to prepare you for the ‘data analytics’ era.\n",
    "One reason for datasets increasing in size is that more and more data is becoming\n",
    "aggregated in (dedicated) databases, such as PaleoDB. The advantage is obvious:\n",
    "if every paleontologist would put collection data into a global database, you can\n",
    "simply search online where important collections of your favorite Dino exist, so\n",
    "that you can pay them a visit for further study. Any biologist who has spent a\n",
    "reasonable length of time going through drawers and kabinets of collected\n",
    "material in a natural history museum will concur.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the fact that data gets aggregated creates ‘global’ and\n",
    "‘comprehensive’ datasets that can reveal patterns that ‘local’ or ‘fragmented’\n",
    "data simply cannot. A very simple example is patterns in occurrence of taxonomic\n",
    "groups. Does genus or family X occur only in Eurasia? Or also in North America,\n",
    "and maybe even in Australia? Even in the $19^{th}$ century, the accumulation of\n",
    "knowledge on where groups of plants and animals lived gave rise to new\n",
    "biogeographic theories, and has led in the $20^{th}$ century not only to support\n",
    "continental drift from theory to fact, but also has helped piece together the\n",
    "course, the merging, and the splitting of continents for the past half billion years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason for considering the data from PaleoDB is far less prosaic. It is\n",
    "structured in so-called JSON format, which is what we happen to consider for\n",
    "today. True, you can also download the data in Tab-delimited format, but hey!,\n",
    "where is the fun in that! And, as we will see at the end of this task, JSON has it’s\n",
    "advantages (but also disadvantages).\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is a very widely used format for data that has many different ‘layers’, and\n",
    "serves a purpose similar to XML. One advantage of working with JSON in Python or\n",
    "other general programming languages, is that JSON in fact has a structure that\n",
    "very much resembles the standard datatypes in Python, notably Dictionaries and\n",
    "Lists. In fact, in a JSON file you’ll only need these:\n",
    "`{:}[,]*`, the stuff that lists and dicts are made of!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start coding, open the `Dinos_reduced.json` file in `gedit`. ‘Reduced’\n",
    "means not all PaleoDB datafields are present, to make the file-size a bit more\n",
    "manageable. <a href=https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/occs/list#response>Information on the data fields can be found here</a>:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** define records, and list tags. If you had to translate, which would you say are\n",
    "dicts, which are lists? Actually, there is only ONE list in the entire file. Locate it."
