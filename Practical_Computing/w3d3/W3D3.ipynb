    "# Reading and Writing Files\n",
    "When working with files, a Jupyter notebook is not always convenient.  \n",
    "Especially for commands that read or write a file, the state of the file changes every time you execute such commands.  \n",
    "Therefore, it is hard to test file commands in a notebook by running the same cell again, e.g. after making corrections.\n",

    "This notebook provides pieces of Python code that you can copy to a Python script in an editor.  \n",
